This is a simple, Maxwell's Equations based simulation of light waves. All derivatives are calculated through numpy and the third dimension has a size of one allowing for fast computation. Since the third dimension does still exist, Maxwell's equations could be implemented without needing significant modification. The simulation also uses permittivity, permeability, and conductivity data. Here is the form of Maxwell's Equations that is used:
